An Open Source Firmware for ESP32 Camera Module

WebLens is an open source firmware designed for the ESP32 camera module that allows users to take pictures, and access an admin interface via the web. With WebLens, you can turn your ESP32 camera module into a fully-functional camera with a user-friendly interface accessible from any device with a web browser.

WebLens is built on top of the ESP32 hardware platform and provides a flexible and easy-to-use interface for controlling the camera module. The firmware allows you to capture still images and send them to an HTTP endpoint. The web user interface makes it easy to configure the settings and view the captured content in real-time.

The firmware is built on top of the popular PlatformIO framework. Additionally, WebLens is fully open source, which means you can customize the firmware to fit your needs or contribute to its development.
